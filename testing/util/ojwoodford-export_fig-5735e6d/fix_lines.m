function fix_lines(fname, fname2)
%FIX_LINES  Improves the line style of eps files generated by print
%
% Examples:
%   fix_lines fname
%   fix_lines fname fname2
%
% This function improves the style of lines in eps files generated by
% MATLAB's print function, making them more similar to those seen on
% screen. Grid lines are also changed from a dashed style to a dotted
% style, for greater differentiation from dashed lines.
% 
% The function also places embedded fonts after the postscript header, in
% versions of MATLAB which place the fonts first (R2006b and earlier), in
% order to allow programs such as Ghostscript to find the bounding box
% information.
%
% IN:
%   fname - Name or path of source eps file.
%   fname2 - Name or path of destination eps file. Default: same as fname.

% The idea of editing the EPS file to change line styles comes from Jiro
% Doke's FIXPSLINESTYLE (fex id: 17928)
% The idea of changing dash length with line width came from comments on
% fex id: 5743, but the implementation is mine :)

% Thank you to Sylvain Favrot for bringing the embedded font/bounding box
% interaction in older versions of MATLAB to my attention.
% Thank you to D Ko for bringing an error with eps files with tiff previews
% to my attention.
% Thank you to Laurence K for suggesting the check to see if the file was
% opened.
